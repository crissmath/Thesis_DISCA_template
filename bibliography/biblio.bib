abstract = {We address the efficient realization of matrix multiplication (gemm), with application in the convolution operator for machine learning, for the RISC-V core present in the GreenWaves GAP8 processor. Our approach leverages BLIS (Basic Linear Algebra Instantiation Software) to develop an implementation that (1) re-organizes the gemm algorithm adapting its micro-kernel to exploit the hardware-supported dot product kernel in the GAP8; (2) explicitly orchestrates the data transfers across the hierarchy of scratchpad memories via DMA (direct memory access); and (3) operates with integer arithmetic.},

abstract="We describe a model of hierarchical memories and we use it to determine an optimal strategy for blocking operand matrices of matrix multiplication. The model is an extension of an earlier related model by three of the authors. As before the model predicts the form of current, state-of-the-art L1 kernels. Additionally, it shows that current L1 kernels can continue to produce their high performance on operand matrices that are as large as the L2 cache. For a hierarchical memory with L memory levels (main memory and L-1 caches), our model reduces the number of potential matrix multiply algorithms from 6Lto four. We use the shape of the matrix input operands to select one of our four algorithms. Previously four was 2Land the model was independent of the matrix operand shapes. Because of space limitations, we do not include performance results.",

abstract = {BLIS is a new software framework for instantiating high-performance BLAS-like dense linear algebra libraries. We demonstrate how BLIS acts as a productivity multiplier by using it to implement the level-3 BLAS on a variety of current architectures. The systems for which we demonstrate the framework include state-of-the-art general-purpose, low-power, and many-core architectures. We show, with very little effort, how the BLIS framework yields sequential and parallel implementations that are competitive with the performance of ATLAS, OpenBLAS (an effort to maintain and extend the GotoBLAS), and commercial vendor implementations such as AMD’s ACML, IBM’s ESSL, and Intel’s MKL libraries. Although most of this article focuses on single-core implementation, we also provide compelling results that suggest the framework’s leverage extends to the multithreaded domain.},

abstract = {Matrix multiplication (GEMM) is a core operation to numerous scientific applications. Traditional implementations of Strassen-like fast matrix multiplication (FMM) algorithms often do not perform well except for very large matrix sizes, due to the increased cost of memory movement, which is particularly noticeable for non-square matrices. Such implementations also require considerable workspace and modifications to the standard BLAS interface. We propose a code generator framework to automatically implement a large family of FMM algorithms suitable for multiplications of arbitrary matrix sizes and shapes. By representing FMM with a triple of matrices [U, V, W] that capture the linear combinations of submatrices that are formed, we can use the Kronecker product to define a multi-level representation of Strassen-like algorithms. Incorporating the matrix additions that must be performed for Strassen-like algorithms into the inherent packing and micro-kernel operations inside GEMM avoids extra workspace and reduces the cost of memory movement. Adopting the same loop structures as high-performance GEMM implementations allows parallelization of all FMM algorithms with simple but efficient data parallelism without the overhead of task parallelism. We present a simple performance model for general FMM algorithms and compare actual performance of 20+ FMM algorithms to modeled predictions. Our implementations demonstrate a performance benefit over conventional GEMM on single core and multi-core systems. This study shows that Strassen-like fast matrix multiplication can be incorporated into libraries for practical use.},

way. This methodology consists of two stages. In the first
one, instrumentation of the source code is performed using
CALL, which is a profiling tool for interacting with the code
in an easy, simple and direct way. New features are added
to CALL to obtain different performace metrics and store
the performance information in XML files. Using this information,
an analytical model of the performance behavior
is obtained in the second stage by means of R, a language
and environment for statistical analysis. The structure of
the whole framework is detailed in this paper, and some selected
examples are used to show its practical use.}

way. This methodology consists of two stages. In the first
one, instrumentation of the source code is performed using
CALL, which is a profiling tool for interacting with the code
in an easy, simple and direct way. New features are added
to CALL to obtain different performace metrics and store
the performance information in XML files. Using this information,
an analytical model of the performance behavior
is obtained in the second stage by means of R, a language
and environment for statistical analysis. The structure of
the whole framework is detailed in this paper, and some selected
examples are used to show its practical use.}

    Abstract = {Despite the move toward chip multiprocessing in the mid-2000s, the problem of machine energy consumption is still a prevalent and growing problem within the computing sector. To evaluate energy consumption at the application level, researchers were previously limited to specialized external instrumentation, modeling or simulation. Thankfully, new microprocessor designs have now exposed a handful of hardware counters that are able to measure energy directly, avoiding many limitations of previous techniques. This work details the capability of these counters, supports their accuracy via other measurement hardware, and explores the energy consumption of common dense and sparse linear algebra routines for various problem sizes and core frequencies.}

abstract="Asymmetric multicore processors have recently emerged as an appealing technology for severely energy-constrained environments, especially in mobile appliances where heterogeneity in applications is mainstream. In addition, given the growing interest for low-power high performance computing, this type of architectures is also being investigated as a means to improve the throughput-per-Watt of complex scientific applications on clusters of commodity systems-on-chip. In this paper, we design and embed several architecture-aware optimizations into a multi-threaded general matrix multiplication (gemm), a key operation of the BLAS, in order to obtain a high performance implementation for ARM big.LITTLE AMPs. Our solution is based on the reference implementation of gemm in the BLIS library, and integrates a cache-aware configuration as well as asymmetric-static and dynamic scheduling strategies that carefully tune and distribute the operation's micro-kernels among the big and LITTLE cores of the target processor. The experimental results on a Samsung Exynos 5422, a system-on-chip with ARM Cortex-A15 and Cortex-A7 clusters that implements the big.LITTLE model, expose that our cache-aware versions of gemm with asymmetric scheduling attain important gains in performance with respect to its architecture-oblivious counterparts while exploiting all the resources of the AMP to deliver considerable energy efficiency.",

  abstract =     "In this paper, we present a number of Application Program
                 Interfaces (APIs) for coding linear algebra algorithms.  On the
                 surface, these APIs for the MATLAB M-script and C programming
                 languages appear to be simple, almost trivial, extensions of those
                 languages.  Yet with them, the task of programming and maintaining
                 families of algorithms for a broad spectrum of linear algebra
                 operations is greatly simplified.  In combination with our Formal
                 Linear Algebra Methods Environment (FLAME) approach to deriving such
                 families of algorithms, dozens of algorithms for a single linear
                 algebra operation can be derived, verified to be correct, implemented,
                 and tested, often in a matter of minutes per algorithm.  Since the
                 algorithms are expressed in code much like they are explained in a
                 classroom setting, these APIs become not just a tool for implementing
                 libraries, but also a valuable tool for teaching the algorithms that
                 are incorporated in the libraries.  In combination with an extension
                 of the Parallel Linear Algebra Package (PLAPACK) API, the approach
                 presents a migratory path from algorithm to MATLAB implementation to
                 high-performance sequential implementation to parallel implementation.
                 Finally, the APIs are being used to create a repository of algorithms
                 and implementations for linear algebra operations, the FLAME Interface
                 REpository (FIRE), which already features hundreds of algorithms for
                 dozens of commonly encountered linear algebra operations.",

                 presented, the correctness of the algorithms carries through to the
                 correctness of the implementations.  Analytically motivated heuristics
                 are used to subsequently choose members from the family that can be
                 expected to yield high performance.  Finally, we report performance on
                 the Intel (R) Pentium (R) III processor that is competitive with that
                 of recursive algorithms reported previously in the literature for this

                 computation and updating of QR factorizations of dense matrices, including 
                 problems large enough to require out-of-core computation, where the matrix 
                 is stored on disk. The algorithms presented here are scalable both in 
                 problem size and as the number of processors increases. Implementation 
                 using the Parallel Linear Algebra Package (PLAPACK) and the Parallel 
                 Out-of-Core Linear Algebra Package (POOCLAPACK) is discussed. The methods 
                 are shown to attain excellent performance, in some cases attaining roughly 
                 80 percent of the  realizable peak of the architectures on which the 
                 experiments were performed.",

  abstract =     "We show how to compute an LU factorization of a matrix when the factors of a leading principle 
                 submatrix are already known. The approach incorporates pivoting akin to partial pivoting,
                 a strategy we call incremental pivoting. An implementation using the Formal Linear Algebra
                 Methods Environment (FLAME) Application Programming Interface (API) is described. Experimental 
                 results demonstrate practical numerical stability and high performance on an Intel Itanium2 
                 processor based server.",

    Abstract = {Extra memory allows parallel matrix multiplication to be done with asymptotically less communication than Cannon’s algorithm and be faster in practice. “3D” algorithms arrange the p processors in a 3D array, and store redundant copies of the matrices on each of p^1/3 layers. ‘2D” algorithms such as Cannon’s algorithm store a single copy of the matrices on a 2D array of processors. We generalize these 2D and 3D algorithms by introducing a new class of “2.5D algorithms”. For matrix multiplication, we can take advantage of any amount of extra memory to store c copies of the data, for any c ∈ {1, 2, ..., p^1/3 }, to reduce the bandwidth cost of Cannon’s algorithm by a factor of c^1/2 and the latency cost by a factor c^3/2 . We also show that these costs reach the lower bounds, modulo polylog(p) factors. We introduce a novel algorithm for 2.5D LU decomposition. To the best of our knowledge, this LU algorithm is the first to minimize communication along the critical path of execution in the 3D case. Our 2.5D LU algorithm uses communication-avoiding pivoting, a stable alternative to partial-pivoting. We prove a novel lower bound on the latency cost of 2.5D and 3D LU factorization, showing that while c copies of the data can also reduce the bandwidth by a factor of c^1/2 , the latency must increase by a factor of c^1/2 , so that the 2D LU algorithm (c = 1) in fact minimizes latency. We provide implementations and performance results for 2D and 2.5D versions of all the new algorithms. Our results demonstrate that 2.5D matrix multiplication and LU algorithms strongly scale more efficiently than 2D algorithms. Each of our 2.5D algorithms performs over 2X faster than the corresponding 2D algorithm for certain problem sizes on 65,536 cores of a BG/P supercomputer.}

  abstract = {Cyclops (cyclic-operations) Tensor Framework (CTF)is a
distributed library for tensor contractions. CTF aims to scale
high-dimensional tensor contractions done in Coupled Cluster
calculations on massively-parallel supercomputers. The framework
preserves tensor symmetry by subdividing tensors cyclically, producing
a highly regular parallel decomposition. The parallel decomposition
effectively hides any high dimensional structure of tensors reducing
the complexity of the distributed contraction algorithm to known
linear algebra methods for matrix multiplication. We also detail the
automatic topology-aware mapping framework deployed by CTF, which maps
tensors of any dimension and structure onto torus networks of any
dimension. We employ virtualization to provide completely general
mapping support while maintaining perfect load balance. Performance of
a preliminary version of CTF on the IBM Blue Gene/P and Cray XE6
supercomputers shows highly efficient weak scaling, demonstrating the
viability of our approach.}

    abstract = {We present performance results for dense linear algebra using recent NVIDIA GPUs. Our matrix-matrix multiply routine (GEMM) runs up to 60\% faster than the vendor's implementation and approaches the peak of hardware capabilities. Our LU, QR and Cholesky factorizations achieve up to 80--90\% of the peak GEMM rate. Our parallel LU running on two GPUs achieves up to \~{}540 Gflop/s. These results are accomplished by challenging the accepted view of the GPU architecture and programming guidelines. We argue that modern GPUs should be viewed as multithreaded multicore vector units. We exploit blocking similarly to vector computers and heterogeneity of the system by computing both on GPU and CPU. This study includes detailed benchmarking of the GPU memory system that reveals sizes and latencies of caches and TLB. We present a couple of algorithmic optimizations aimed at increasing parallelism and regularity in the problem that provide us with slightly higher performance.},

                 reduction of full matrices to banded or tridiagonal
                 form and the reduction of banded matrices to narrower
                 banded or tridiagonal form, possibly in multiple steps.
                 Our framework leads to algorithms that require fewer
                 floating-point operations than do standard algorithms,
                 if only the eigenvalues are required. In addition, it
                 allows for space--time tradeoffs and enables or
                 increases the use of blocked transformations.",

                 reduction of banded matrices to narrower banded or

one, instrumentation of the source code is performed using
CALL, which is a profiling tool for interacting with the code
in an easy, simple and direct way. New features are added
to CALL to obtain different performace metrics and store
the performance information in XML files. Using this information,
an analytical model of the performance behavior
is obtained in the second stage by means of R, a language
and environment for statistical analysis. The structure of
the whole framework is detailed in this paper, and some selected
examples are used to show its practical use.}

abstract="We have discovered a new implementation of theqd algorithm that has a far wider  domain of stability than Rutishauser's version. Our algorithm was developed from an examination of the {\{}Cholesky{\textasciitilde}LR{\}} transformation and can be adapted to parallel computation in stark contrast to traditional qd. Our algorithm also yieldsuseful a posteriori upper and lower bounds on the smallest singularvalue of a bidiagonal matrix.The zero-shift bidiagonal QR of Demmel and Kahan computes the smallest singularvalues to maximal relative accuracy and the others to maximal absolute accuracywith little or no  degradation in efficiency when compared with theLINPACK code. Our algorithm obtains maximal relative accuracy for allthe singular values and runs at least four times faster than the LINPACK code.",
